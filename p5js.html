                        It was 16”x16”painting, dark grey background, of a white woman with brown hair pulled up, facing right. It was also 2 inches thick. Her hair is pulled up in a grey shawl, and her shoulders are covered in a black shawl. Underneath it is an olive grey shawl.

                        I wrote the code for this alien face by analyzing and studying the example project code that the professor showed us. I found it challenging to maintain the proportion of the eyes and pupils according to movement.

                        The idea behind the 'End of Semester Clock' is to create a visual representation of the progress through the semester. The clock will track the time from August 26, 2024, to December 13, 2024, and display the progress as a percentage.

                        I tracked how much water I drank throughout the week, depending on the day. My data portrait records the total amount of water I drank each day and presents it in a way that’s easy to understand using the number of glasses. For example, on Monday, 8 out of 12 glasses are filled, which means I drank 8 glasses of water that day.

                        This game is a reflection of my life, from my school days in Korea to just before I came to the U.S. In Korea, I failed my first attempt at the college entrance exams, and my second attempt didn’t go as planned either. Yet, in a turn of fate, I was accepted into Parsons, an opportunity that brought me to New York
